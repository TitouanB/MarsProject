files :
	- 4 scripts are present with their header:
		- 2 real time scripts :
			- main1PointCamera
			- mainGridCamera
		- 2 scripts 'image' working with images :
			- main1PointImage
			- mainGridImage
	- 2 ppt files used during the experiment with a line of dots
	- images recorded during the different experiments

The scripts 'image' work with images, in particular with the images recorded during the experiments present in this folder.

The script main1PointCamera works weel but the script mainGridCamera works only if a grid of dots is projected in front of the camera, otherwise the sort algorithm bugs.
